## What is BitChat?  

BitChat is a messenger that works **with or without the internet**:  

- **Without internet**: Uses Bluetooth to create a **local mesh network** that cannot be shut down.  
- **With internet**: Connects through the **Nostr protocol**, a global decentralized network.  

Unlike WhatsApp or Messenger, BitChat:  
- Doesn‚Äôt require phone numbers or accounts  
- Doesn‚Äôt rely on central servers  
- Encrypts all messages with the **Noise Protocol**  
- Identifies users by **public key ID + nickname**  

üëâ Resistant to **censorship, surveillance, and shutdowns**.

## Why Palestinians Should Use BitChat  

1. **Stay Connected During Outages** ‚Äì Works even if internet is cut off.  
2. **Privacy & Security** ‚Äì No numbers, accounts, or corporate servers.  
3. **Dual Connectivity** ‚Äì Switches between mesh (local) and Nostr (global).  
4. **Geohash Channels** ‚Äì Join location-based chats (e.g., Gaza City, Palestine).  
5. **No Extra Setup** ‚Äì Just phones, no servers required.

## How to Use BitChat  

1. Install the BitChat application.  
2. After granting the necessary permissions, you will land on a screen similar to this (your messages list will be empty):

3. In **`bitchat/@symbolic`**, your username is `@symbolic`. You can change it by clicking on it.  
4. Next to it is **`#mesh`**, which is the default location-based channel.  
5. Tap on it to see all available channels. Ignore channels other than `mesh` unless you‚Äôre connected to the internet.

6. To the right of the **‚Äútype a message...‚Äù** box is a **slash icon** inside a circle. Tap it to open the command menu. Each command has its usage listed.

7. You can create a new channel using **`/join <channel-name>`** command. For example by typing **`/join xyz`** you will join channel **`xyz`**. It will also create the channel **`xyz`** if not already created.
8. A channel is just like a WhatsApp group. After joining you can message to only users inside it.
> ‚ö†Ô∏è On Android, this feature is still buggy ‚Äî messages are sent to everyone, not just the channel.  
9. For private messaging: click on the `people icon` (top-right). A side panel will open with users. Click on any one to start a private chat. When you are in private chat, the color will change from **`green`** to **`orange`**.
