## What is BitChat?  

BitChat is a messenger that works **with or without internet**:  

- **Without internet**: uses Bluetooth to create a **local mesh network** that canâ€™t be shut down.  
- **With internet**: connects through the **Nostr protocol**, a global decentralized network.  

Unlike WhatsApp or Messenger, BitChat:  
- Doesnâ€™t need phone numbers or accounts  
- Doesnâ€™t rely on central servers  
- Encrypts all messages with the **Noise Protocol**  
- Identifies users by **public key ID + nickname**  

ðŸ‘‰ Resistant to **censorship, surveillance, and shutdowns**.
